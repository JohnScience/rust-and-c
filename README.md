# Rust and C: equivalents and differences

This is a collection of side-by-side comparisons of Rust and C code snippets, with an emphasis on the differences between the two languages.

It was written with the intention to identify the smallest yet most capable subset of Rust, so that teaching Rust could be simplified to the level of C.

The result of such approach is that the learners of Rust will first learn unidiomatic, unsafe but still valid Rust, and then gradually learn the idiomatic Rust as they progress.

Coincidentally, it can be a great introduction to Rust for C programmers.
